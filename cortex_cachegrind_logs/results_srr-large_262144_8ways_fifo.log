==58556== 
==58556==     Valgrind's memory management: out of memory:
==58556==        newSuperblock's request for 4194304 bytes failed.
==58556==           72,740,864 bytes have already been mmap-ed ANONYMOUS.
==58556==     Valgrind cannot continue.  Sorry.
==58556== 
==58556==     There are several possible reasons for this.
==58556==     - You have some kind of memory limit in place.  Look at the
==58556==       output of 'ulimit -a'.  Is there a limit on the size of
==58556==       virtual memory or address space?
==58556==     - You have run out of swap space.
==58556==     - Valgrind has a bug.  If you think this is the case or you are
==58556==     not sure, please let us know and we'll try to fix it.
==58556==     Please note that programs can take substantially more memory than
==58556==     normal when running under Valgrind tools, eg. up to twice or
==58556==     more, depending on the tool.  On a 64-bit machine, Valgrind
==58556==     should be able to make use of up 32GB memory.  On a 32-bit
==58556==     machine, Valgrind should be able to use all the memory available
==58556==     to a single process, up to 4GB if that's how you have your
==58556==     kernel configured.  Most 32-bit Linux setups allow a maximum of
==58556==     3GB per process.
==58556== 
==58556==     Whatever the reason, Valgrind cannot continue.  Sorry.
