USAGE: 
./spc data_file n m k SIGMA DIV_FACTOR
data_file = dataset text file in the format specified below 
n = total number of data points 
m = dimensionality of data 
k = number of desired clusters
SIGMA = Gauss Kernel Sigma (typically set it to 0.707)
DIV_FACTOR = Factor to avoid overflowing. Might require for Data-points 
very far away or with very high abs value (typically set it to 1) 

**** data_file format ****
data_file should be in the form nxm
n = number of rows (total number of data points)
m = number of columns (data point dimensions)
