==40585==  If you believe this happened as a result of a stack
==40585==  overflow in your program's main thread (unlikely but
==40585==  possible), you can try to increase the size of the
==40585==  main thread stack using the --main-stacksize= flag.
==40585==  The main thread stack size used in this run was 8388608.
