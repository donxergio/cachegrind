==30759==  If you believe this happened as a result of a stack
==30759==  overflow in your program's main thread (unlikely but
==30759==  possible), you can try to increase the size of the
==30759==  main thread stack using the --main-stacksize= flag.
==30759==  The main thread stack size used in this run was 8388608.
